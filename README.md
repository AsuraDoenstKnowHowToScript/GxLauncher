# GxLauncher
GxLauncher is a lightweight, Python-powered game launcher built for speed and customization. It tracks your playtime, lets you add custom covers, and keeps everything clean and organized — whether your games came from Hydra or whatever shady warehouse you dragged them out of. Simple, fast, and fully tweakable.
