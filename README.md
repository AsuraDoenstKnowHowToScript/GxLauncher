# GxLauncher

GxLauncher is a lightweight, Python-powered game launcher built for speed, customization, and zero nonsense.
It tracks your playtime, supports custom covers, and keeps your entire game library clean and organized — whether it’s a clean install or something modded beyond recognition.

A perfect example? Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 modded.
If you use XVINS or other modding tools, you know the pain of the game’s .exe randomly disappearing, moving somewhere cursed, or acting like it’s being hunted by the Time Patrol.
With GxLauncher, your launch point stays in one stable place, no matter how chaotic your mod folder becomes.

Fast to run.
Simple to use.
Fully tweakable to your taste.
